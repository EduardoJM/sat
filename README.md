# Demonstrative Separating Axis Theorem

This is an small demonstrative implementation of the Separating Axis Theorem projections in JavaScript using HTML5 Canvas rendering. This is created by me, Eduardo Oliveira, to show in my YouTube video: [**Alguns Bits de Matemática #1 - Teorema de Separação por Eixos e a Detecção de Colisão**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wH9A_ZjqjkU), in brazilian portuguese in my channel.
